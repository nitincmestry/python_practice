# Python Basic Exercise for Beginners

Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.
```
Given 1:

number1 = 20
number2 = 30
Expected Output: The result is 600

Given 2:

number1 = 40
number2 = 30
Expected Output: The result is 70
```
-------------------------------------------

Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number
Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.
```
Expected Output:

Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17
```

Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.
```
Expected Output:

Orginal String is  pynative
Printing only even index chars
p
n
t
v
```
----------------------------------------

Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
```
For example:

remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, we need to remove the first four characters from a string.
remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here, we need to remove the first two characters from a string.
```

Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same
