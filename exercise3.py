Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

For example, str = "pynative" so you should display 'p', 'n', 't', 'v'.
'''

# word = input("Enter the word:")
# print("Printing only even index chars")
# print("Orginal String is:", word)

# for i in word[0::2]:
#     print(i)

# accept input string from a user
word = input('Enter word ')
print("Original String:", word)

# using list slicing
# convert string to list
# pick only even index chars
x = list(word)
for i in x[0::2]:
    print(i)
